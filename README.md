**FIRSTLY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF LITTLE BIT. 

Hello Sir/Ma'am Im Suhani,currently I am Btech Second year student .
I am passionate for coding and it is fun for me as it brings exciting challenges.
I have started my coding jorney from the middle of the first year with the exciting topic that is "Data structure and algorithm". 
Made my github profile so that I can be consistent with my coding journey , on twiteer i follow 100 days of code competition .
From last 1 months after the completion of my DSA journey I started learning Web devlopment.
Beside this in my school days I have also learned JAVA language, as my course subject.
I am thrilled to be here and excited to join technojam club so that I can learn from our senior.

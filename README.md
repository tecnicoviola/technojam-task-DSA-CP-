# technojam-task-DSA-CP-

**FIRSTLY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF LITTLE BIT. 

Hello Sir/Ma'am Im Suhani,currently I am Btech Second year student .
I am passionate for coding and it is fun for me as it brings exciting challenges.
I have started my coding jorney from the middle of the first year with the exciting topic that is "Data structure and algorithm". 
Made my github profile so that I can be consistent with my coding journey , on twiteer i follow 100 days of code competition .
From last 1 months after the completion of my DSA journey I started learning Web devlopment.
Beside this in my school days I have also learned JAVA language, as my course subject.
I am thrilled to be here and excited to join technojam club so that I can learn from our senior.


**HOW DID I APPROACH MY TASK.


As i have more knowledge in DSA  than web-dev part as I have just started my Webdevlopment journey so I have chosen DSA as my working domain.
In DSA domain I saw there are 3 section Easy, Medium, Hard.
#* I sarted  with Easy section, by understanding the first question that is reverse an array or string ,writing its     
   algorithm then writing the main code.
#* In the same way I have solved rest of the question.
#* Then there is medium type question in this i faced few challenges in understanding the question.
#* In this medium section few questions were challenging and I have learned new concept like tower of hanoi, factorial of   
   large number is interesting question. It took me long to think the algorithm of this question.
#* Last section based on difficult type of question, with very good question . I have learnt new concept that is "State of      Eratosthenes" to solve one of the question in which it has asked prime number between given interval. 


**CHALLENGES I FACED WHILE SOLVING THE CODES GIVEN IN THE TASK.

#* Easy questions were easy to tackle, just that third question that is missing number question was tricky one it took me time to think the algorithm of this question

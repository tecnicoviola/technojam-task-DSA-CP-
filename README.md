# technojam-task-DSA-CP-

**FIRSTLY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF LITTLE BIT. 

1.Hello Sir/Ma'am Im Suhani,currently I am Btech Second year student .
2.I am passionate for coding and it is fun for me as it brings exciting challenges.
3.I have started my coding jorney from the middle of the first year with the exciting topic that is "Data structure and algorithm". 
4.Made my github profile so that I can be consistent with my coding journey , on twiteer i follow 100 days of code competition .
5.From last 1 months after the completion of my DSA journey I started learning Web devlopment.
6.Beside this in my school days I have also learned JAVA language, as my course subject.
7.I am thrilled to be here and excited to join technojam club so that I can learn from our senior.


**HOW DID I APPROACH MY TASK.


1.As i have more knowledge in DSA  than web-dev part as I have just started my Webdevlopment journey so I have chosen DSA as my working domain.
2.In DSA domain I saw there are 3 section Easy, Medium, Hard.
3.I sarted  with Easy section, by understanding the first question that is reverse an array or string ,writing its     
   algorithm then writing the main code.
4.In the same way I have solved rest of the question.
5.Then there is medium type question in this i faced few challenges in understanding the question.
6.In this medium section few questions were challenging and I have learned new concept like tower of hanoi, factorial of   
   large number is interesting question. It took me long to think the algorithm of this question.
7.Last section based on difficult type of question, with very good question . I have learnt new concept that is "State of      Eratosthenes" to solve one of the question in which it has asked prime number between given interval. 


**CHALLENGES I FACED WHILE SOLVING THE CODES GIVEN IN THE TASK.

1.Easy questions were easy to tackle, just that third question that is missing number question was tricky one it took me time to think the algorithm of this question
